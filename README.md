# Blender-V-theme
üèÜ Darker UI with context matching colors for selection, editing, highlighting through all the editors.
I created this theme because a lot of users in the community were asking for a darker theme that was sober to read even if you‚Äôre an experienced 3D user or a client gazing at the workspace. I wanted to make it easier for the UI to point to the little crucial buttons in the UI which were grayed when you click on them.
